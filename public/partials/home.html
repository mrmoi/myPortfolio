          <p>Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Moises Martinez and I am an Information Technology
             major at Arizona State University and possess an associateâ€™s degree in Computer Information
             Systems from Scottsdale Community College. As part of the degree and as personal interest,
             I have experience developing front-end applications using languages such as HTML, CSS, and
             JavaScript. In addition, I have worked with languages such as C, C++, and Java under an academic
             environment. Through this portfolio I will share some of the projects I have done for school,
             work, and in my spare time.
